## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### About Me:
- I am Mayur V, a seasoned **BI Analyst** with 1 years of experience, who is very enthusiastic about data science & analytics. I love providing value to decision-makers and business stakeholders in the form of dashboarding solutions, ad-hoc reporting, data cleaing and reconciliation, data validation, etc., among other things.
- I currently work as an **Associate BI Analyst** at [Leadenhall Analytics](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/leadenhallanalytics).
- I am a [Microsoft Certified](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/MayurV19/961493AE734B5BEF?sharingId=8EC6BA7852B248D) **Power BI Data Analyst**, with expansive skills and experience in ingesting, preparing, analyzing and presenting data in Power BI reports and dashboards.
- At my work, I work on enhancing and maintaining critical **MI Dashboards**, gathering and clarifying dashboarding requirements and proving ad-hoc exploration reports to assist in data driven decision-making 
- During my off days, I am busy in building real-time, industry relevant, portfolio projects that not only demonstrate my technical and tool skills, but also showcase my DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE understanding of specific industries. I am also a leaner at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) and [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/) where I learn about newer concepts and how technology skills can be leveraged for impact.

Enough of listening to me for so long... :-D

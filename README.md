## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### About Me:
- I am Mayur V, an aspiring data analyst and a data enthusiast proficient in Python, SQL, Power BI and Excel. I am a continuous learner and am constantly working to upgrade my knowledge and skills to improve my employability.
- I have completed the [IBM Data Science Specialization](https://coursera.org/verify/professional-cert/Q556BW4FYTY4) during which I learnt about Databases, Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning.
- I recently passed the Exam PL-300 and got [Microsoft Certified](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/MayurV19/961493AE734B5BEF?sharingId=8EC6BA7852B248D) as a **Power BI Data Analyst** demonstrating my proficieny in using Power BI.
- These days, I am busy in building real-time, industry relevant, portfolio projects that not only demonstrate my technical and tool skills, but also showcase my DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE understanding of specific industries. I am also a leaner at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) and [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/) where I learn about newer concepts and how technology skills can be leveraged for impact.

Enough of listening to me for so long... :-D
